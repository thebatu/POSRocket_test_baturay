Validations:
  - the code that performs the validations and the logic is
    if(!(validators[key](parsedJson[key])))
      { return false }
      we pass json data as a param to our Validations function and perform the validation logic. if all passes return value id true.

    Validators is the validation function to which we pass the json data(ParsedJson) as a param to be validated.
    [key] is just an index to find the proper keys in the json and the objects to which we pass the data.

    the algorithm recursively passes each key/value to the testing function. Each iteration check whether the json key is an object
      or an Array of objects if it is. we repass it again to the function validate until last node is found in the json data.
